Lectorial 2 : Relational Database Model (Emily Zhou)

1. relational model represents the database as a collection of relations.
2. term "table" > loosely when data are structured into rows and columns.
3. Inegrity Constraints - Key Constraint, Entity Intergrity Constraint, Domain Constraints

The relational model
1. the model is based on a single structure to represent data.
2. each colum is an attribute of the table
3. each row is a record
4. relation model is based on a single relation model
5. each relation should have a primary key - this key can be 1 or multiple attributes

used Movie.db as an example to explain about primary keys

-primary key are unique identifiers for a record,ex: studentiD, email and phone number
-any database will carry out a unique identity.
-some unique entitys can carry two entitys,ex: customer name + email address

from the movie.db

Query

* Select all from movie "Select * FROM MOVIE"
- we can query whatever information we are looking for

6. Tuples are the rows of data in a relation comprising components tha are atomic

Query
*Select * from MEMBER
- the data in date is one value, u cannot split it into multiple components

7. Schema of a relation is a set of relational tables and associated items that are related to one another.

- the schema only includes the attribute names and table name
